## 360 Project Proposal (Milestone 1)

Members: Aryan Agnihotri and Joss White

Project Description and Details

- We are going to undertake creating a forum (MyDiscussionForum) website like Reddit/Hackernews. The site will have users engaging in online discussions for those who are registered and viewing for those who are not. Users will be able to create an account with proper validation, post “threads”, comment and like/dislike the posts. Additionally, we will allow users to share the posts/threads on different platforms. There will be different categories/discussion threads relating to the comments/posts posted. For example, “food reviews” thread will have posts only relating to food reviews, and etc.
- There will be contextual menus using CSS style layout and validation using JavaScript and Server-side scripting with PHP for get/post methods such as initiating threads/comments.  There will also be a filter option to see top posts in the thread, another filter within the comment section per post to see which post was liked the most and sorting by date. There will also be a feature to block specific users, communities, as well as following a specific page.
- Each discussion will be stored in a database using MySQL and there will be proper security implemented for users and data. Asynchronous updates will also be implemented for automatic refresh for updated posts for other users.
- Error handling will be taken care of in the profile section drop down menu with “help center” and “contact customer support” buttons. Usability goals/UI will also be implemented carefully for proper, safe, and engaging interaction with the website by the users. This will aid in achieving higher traffic from users and interaction.
- Guidelines: add posts only relating to the thread topic, meaning stay on topic. For example, cars thread should only have posts relating to cars. Be kind in comments and not toxic (no use of curse words, vulgarity, and etc), those who do not oblige will be reported and banned.
- Contact box to contact the admins/creators of the discussion form in footer of the page
